### PFR test fonts

Test fonts in PFR ([Bitstream TrueDoc Portable Font Resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueDoc)) format. **totofu** is based on **Noto Sans Regular** (with a full character set) while **totosm** is a subset that only contains the characters “Hnot”. The PFR fonts with `_bmp` filename suffix have embedded bitmaps at the ppm sizes 18 and 24.

The PFR fonts are located in the [pfr](./pfr/) folder. The [src](./src/) folder contains the TTF fonts they were created from.

The totopfr fonts are published under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html). They are based on the Noto Sans Regular fonts (Copyright 2012 Google Inc. All Rights Reserved.).
