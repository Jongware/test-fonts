# GX Variation test fonts
### Test fonts in OpenType TT (.ttf) format with TrueType GX font variation tables

These fonts are conversions of fonts published under the OFL into the OpenType TT (.ttf) format with TrueType GX font variation tables (`gvar`, `fvar`), which allows “MultipleMaster”-like functionality aka responsive fonts. Such tables are principally supported in Mac OS X and in most recent versions of FreeType. These fonts are intended for testing purposes. 

* [Sorcery Sans GX](./SorcerySansGX-OFL) is a GX variation font based on Source Sans Pro, by Paul D. Hunt, Adobe Systems. A `.ttc` font collection is also available which implements an additional small-caps only font, created via the [pyftfeatfreeze](https://github.com/twardoch/fonttools-utils/tree/master/pyftfeatfreeze) tool.
* [Zelcin GX](./ZelcinGX-OFL) is a GX variation font based on Cinzel Decorative, by Natanael Gama, ndiscovered.com
